# Timetable Telegram bot for school

ðŸ‘€ This was a personal project that i developed when i was in high school.

This telegram bot helped students and teachers in my school get an up-to-date schedule for each day in the most convenient way possible.

The app was used by 60+ people every day with more than 300 total users. The main focus during the development was on utilizing data to make product decisions. Because of this, the bot has sufficient analytics and logging functionality, which have helped to uncover some interesting trends.
